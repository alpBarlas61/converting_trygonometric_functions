# converting_trygonometric_functions

---Program Features
1-Users are able to choose any basic six trygonometric functions(sin,cos,tan,cot,sec,csc)
2-Users are able to convert any angle value , negative or positive,more or less than 360 degree... It doesn't matter
3-Program simplifies angles and convert the function into 0-90 degree interval expressions (Expm: cos120>>> -cos60 or -sin30)
4-Program will continue to work untill user print "N" onto screen


---Division Remainders
  Program finds the basic interval of the angle you entered [Exmp: You entered 760 , program simplifies it to 40 degree(760=2*360+40;2 is called as mod) because both of these angles gives same results.]
